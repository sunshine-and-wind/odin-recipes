    <h1>PERFECT RIB EYE w/MARINADE (Truffoni's Style)</h1>
    <img src="steak.png" alt="a delicious rib eye steak">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Often times after a dangerous night your customers will come along and want you to make them a steak. 
        This Rib Eye recipe will really hit the spot. However, be wary of groups of young men ordering this rare with 
        only a glass of water. They do something called "sloppy steaks", about which the less said the better.
        You can't stop someone from ordering a steak and a glass of water, but you can have one of your servers 
        keep an eye on the table.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (1/2 pound) rib-eye steaks</li>
        <li>garlic powder to taste</li>
        <li>onion powder to taste</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1-3/4 cups Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1/3 cup brown sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Season the steaks with the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Pour the Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar into a large resealable plastic bag, seal, and shake to mix.</li>
        <li>Pour half of the marinade into another large resealable bag.</li>
        <li>Place two steaks in each bag, and turn to coat. Squeeze out excess air, and seal the bags. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat grill for high heat. Drain the marinade from the steaks into a small saucepan, and bring to a boil; boil for several minutes.</li>
        <li>Brush grill grate with oil. Grill steaks 7 minutes per side, to desired doneness. Baste often with the boiled marinade during the final 5 minutes of cook time.</li>
        <li>Serve with Red Wine, Club Soda w/Lime, or a dark Stout. NOT WATER ONLY.</li>
    </ol>
